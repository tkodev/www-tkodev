      'Web telemetry SDK package that unified observability across multiple lines of business. This project established organization-wide insights into performance metrics, enabling actionable diagnostics and SLO monitoring through a flexible, reusable SDK built on OpenTelemetry.',
    desc: 'As Web Lead for Loblaws Digital Telemetry, I architected and developed a cross-platform telemetry SDK package (Node.js / Next.js) using low-level OpenTelemetry APIs, which was adopted across multiple lines of business (LOBs) within Loblaws Digital. I proposed scalable web architecture, SDK structure, data flows, and Grafana dashboard POC to leadership and executive team across LOBs, platforms, and affiliated projects. I co-led technical design conversations with engineering leads to collect requirements and alignment on instrumentation strategy and telemetry adoption. I implemented core telemetry events and instrumentation patterns (traces, metrics, logs), ensuring compatibility with both server-side (Node) and client-side (browser) runtimes. I abstracted differences in LOB-specific needs, Next.js features/versions, and runtime environments to deliver a flexible and reusable SDK. I built a zustand-powered state store with historical state tracking to enrich trace context and frontend observability. I designed and developed custom data transformation logic to feed into the broader VictoriaMetrics, Tempo, and Grafana observability stack. This enabled organization-wide insights into performance metrics including page load durations, frontend error rates, and SLO breaches — with emphasis on actionable P95 latency breakdowns and user-centric diagnostics.',

These initiatives revolutionized how users interacted with Aeroplan’s services, enabling seamless reward earning, better user experiences, and regulatory compliance across their platform.',
    desc: `
      My engagements with Aeroplan encompassed a diverse range of projects that addressed user experience, accessibility, and technical scalability across their ecosystem:
      
      **Aeroplan Shopping Button Browser Extension**: As the lead developer, I architected Aeroplan’s first cross-browser web extension, which supported hundreds of retailer sites. The extension enabled users to earn points seamlessly while shopping online. Utilizing an SWR-based query system, I overcame CORS limitations to provide real-time updates, implemented multi-domain navigation tracking for uninterrupted purchase sessions, and designed a multi-layer caching system to reduce backend load and enhance performance.
      
      **Aeroplan Retailer and Catalog Redesign**: I spearheaded the implementation of the eStore’s retailer catalog and filtering system redesign to create a more intuitive shopping experience. My contributions included implementing a componentized React architecture, Redux-based state management, and whitelabel theming to improve scalability. These updates allowed users to more easily locate retailers and discover Aeroplan earning opportunities, significantly improving engagement.
      
      **AODA AA / WCAG Compliance**: Leading Aeroplan’s accessibility initiative, I ensured their eStore met AODA AA and WCAG 2.0 compliance standards. This involved auditing the platform, implementing semantic HTML, and enhancing keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility. These changes ensured equitable access for all users and alignment with regulatory requirements.
      
      **eStore Initial Architecture and MVP**: I was instrumental in laying the groundwork for Aeroplan’s eStore by developing its initial architecture and MVP. This project involved designing scalable front-end and server-side solutions with React and Node.js, enabling future feature expansion. The MVP provided users with a streamlined way to redeem points online, setting a strong foundation for ongoing development.
      
      **Technical Innovations and Team Leadership**: Across all projects, I integrated modern development practices, including monorepos for streamlined code management, CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployments, and modular design systems for reusable components. I also led and mentored teams, ensuring consistent code quality, fostering knowledge sharing, and aligning technical solutions with business objectives.
      
      **Proposal Development and Client Engagement**: I collaborated with Aeroplan stakeholders to develop proposals for new projects, including feature enhancements, performance optimizations, and accessibility improvements. My contributions helped secure client buy-in for three engagements and align project goals with Aeroplan’s strategic vision.
      
      These contributions collectively elevated Aeroplan’s digital platform, driving user satisfaction and operational efficiency while adhering to stringent technical and regulatory standards. My work with Aeroplan exemplifies the power of combining technical expertise with a user-centered approach to deliver impactful, scalable solutions.

      'During the Web 1.0 era, I honed my skills in web design and illustration, creating pixel-perfect layouts with early tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, Dreamweaver and FrontPage. These projects reflected the limitations and creativity of the time, leveraging HTML before the advent of HTML5, CSS3, and flex / grid based layouts (tables!), all while navigating the challenges of dial-up internet speeds.',
    desc: 'This period marked the beginning of my journey as a designer and developer, where creativity thrived within constraints of Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer 6 and rudimentary Javascript. I specialized at the time in designing sliced Photoshop templates for web and ventured into creating custom themes for various apps, such as Sony Ericsson Phones and Winamp. These projects showcased my early love for technology while producing visually engaging and technically sound designs that laid the groundwork for my future in web development.',

    desc: 'At OCAD University, I delved deeply into the interplay between design and functionality, focusing on interior design, architecture, and the broader principles of user experience. This period was defined by a passion for art history, architectural history, and the engineering aspects of design. My projects often involved creating architectural models that merged precision engineering with artistic creativity, paying homage to historic architecture through recreations and inspired works. I developed technical drawing skills, mastered 3D software like Revit, Fusion 360, and Blender, and crafted physical models that emphasized the relationship between form and function. This experience enriched my understanding of design as a holistic practice, where aesthetics and usability converge to create impactful spaces and concepts.',

    title: '3D Modeling and Industrial Design',
    intro:
      'My 3D modeling journey began as a hobby, driven by a desire to merge creativity with practicality. I explored solving everyday problems by designing custom prints, reimagined forms for existing devices, and assembled parts for PC and electronic builds, pushing the boundaries of what functional design could achieve.',
    desc: 'This hands-on exploration allowed me to dive deep into industrial design, using tools like Fusion 360 and Blender to create models that are both innovative and practical. From crafting 3D-printed solutions for everyday challenges to prototyping new forms and integrating parts for advanced electronic projects, I focused on bridging digital design with physical functionality. The process reinforced my passion for building solutions that enhance usability while maintaining a refined, aesthetic approach.',
